I want to thank all the attendees of this session.
I hope I could at least wake your interest for functional programming.

Here is the link to the same talk from Scott Wlaschin:
[The power of composition](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/composition/)

Also if you would like to know more about functional programming
please look at Scott Wlaschin blos posts and talks.
They are really good and I think you can apply this methods in other programming languages, not just F#.

Again, thanks for watching my session and I hope to meet you again next year.
