Notes by Matthias 'Yolgie' Holzinger
* Ask (anonymosly) if everyone is commited & feels secure enough to share/tell the truth
	* Anonymity via Facilitator, Preprinted notes where you only have to add x, TeamEcho, ...
* Start by getting everybody to say something, this makes it easier for them to say something during the retro
* Timeboxed (15+5 per Teammember per Week)
* Get a Facilitator/Coach/ScrumMaster who does not have a stake in the team itself
* No place for figures of authority
* Action Items Must Haves:
	* Measurable
	* Responsible Person
	* Deadline
	* Track/Revisit in next Retro
